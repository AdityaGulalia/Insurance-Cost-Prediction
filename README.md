## Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using a basic machine learning model. The goal of the project is to understand the complete supervised learning pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The dataset contains information such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region, and the corresponding insurance charges. These features are used to train a Linear Regression model that estimates the cost of insurance for an individual.

The project begins with loading and exploring the dataset to understand the structure, data types, and relationships between variables. Categorical features such as sex, smoker, and region are converted into numerical form using one-hot encoding. The data is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data. A Linear Regression model is trained on the training set, and its performance is measured using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R² score.

To improve the model’s performance, a log transformation is applied to the target variable, which helps reduce the effect of extreme values and produces more stable predictions. The final model achieves an R² score of approximately 0.80, meaning it explains around 80% of the variation in insurance charges. One of the main insights from the model is that smoking status has the most significant impact on insurance costs.

This project demonstrates the fundamental steps involved in building a regression model and provides a strong foundation for more advanced machine learning tasks. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, proper evaluation, and simple model improvements in achieving better predictive performance.
